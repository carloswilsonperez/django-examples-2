Iterables are objects that can return one of their elements at a time, such as a list.
Many of the built-in functions weâ€™ve used so far, like 'enumerate,' return an iterator.

An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. This is different from a list,
which is also an iterable, but is not an iterator because it is not a stream of data.

Generators are a simple way to create iterators using functions. You can also define iterators
using classes, which you can read more about
